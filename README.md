rtw89 v5
===========

### WORKS WITH UBUNTU 20.04 via dkms:

```bash
sudo -i
apt update
apt install make gcc linux-headers-$(uname -r) build-essential git dkms
git clone https://github.com/DelloxD1/rtw89.git /usr/src/rtw89-1
dkms add -m rtw89 -v 1
dkms build -m rtw89 -v 1
dkms install -m rtw89 -v 1
```


### A repo for the newest Realtek rtlwifi codes.

This branch has v5 of the code, which is latest from Realtek.

This code will build on any kernel 5.4 and newer as long as the distro has not modified
any of the kernel APIs. IF YOU RUN UBUNTU, YOU CAN BE ASSURED THAT THE APIs HAVE CHANGED.
NO, I WILL NOT MODIFY THE SOURCE FOR YOU. YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN!!!!!

I am working on fixing builds on older kernels.

This repository includes drivers for the following card:

Realtek 8852AE

If you are looking for a driver for chips such as 
RTL8188EE, RTL8192CE, RTL8192CU, RTL8192DE, RTL8192EE, RTL8192SE, RTL8723AE, RTL8723BE, or RTL8821AE,
these should be provided by your kernel. If not, then you should go to the Backports Project
(https://backports.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page) to obtain the necessary code.

### Installation instruction
##### Requirements
You will need to install "make", "gcc", "kernel headers", "kernel build essentials", and "git".
You can install them with the following command, on **Ubuntu**:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install make gcc linux-headers-$(uname -r) build-essential git
```
If any of the packages above are not found check if your distro installs them like that. 

##### Installation
For all distros:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lwfinger/rtw89.git -b v5
cd rtw89
make
sudo make install
```
##### How to disable/enable a Kernel module
 ```bash
sudo modprobe -r rtw89pci         #This unloads the module
sudo modprobe rtw89pci            #This loads the module
```

##### Problem with recovery after sleep or hibernation
Some BIOSs have trouble changing power state from D3hot to D0. If you have this problem, then

sudo cp suspend_rtw89 /usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/.

That script will unload the driver before sleep or hibernation, and reload it following resumption.

##### Option configuration
If it turns out that your system needs one of the configuration options, then do the following:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/<dev_name>.conf 
```
There, enter the line below:
```bash
options <device_name> <<driver_option_name>>=<value>
```
The available options for rtw89pci are disable_clkreq, disable_aspm, and disable_aspm
The available options for rtw89core are debug_mask, and disable_ps_mode

Normally, none of these will be needed.

***********************************************************************************************

When your kernel changes, then you need to do the following:
```bash
cd ~/rtw89
git pull
make
sudo make install
```

Remember, this MUST be done whenever you get a new kernel - no exceptions.

These drivers will not build for kernels older than 5.4. If you must use an older kernel,
submit a GitHub issue with a listing of the build errors. Without the errors, the issue
will be ignored. I am not a mind reader.

When you have problems where the driver builds and loads correctly, but fails to work, a GitHub
issue is NOT the best place to report it. I have no idea of the internal workings of any of the
chips, and the Realtek engineers who do will not read these issues. To reach them, send E-mail to
linux-wireless@vger.kernel.org. Include a detailed description of any messages in the kernel
logs and any steps that you have taken to analyze or fix the problem. If your description is
not complete, you are unlikely to get any satisfaction.
